# Stop-watch
This is a simple Stopwatch Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, pause, reset, and track elapsed time directly in the browser. The project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, JavaScript timing functions, and basic UI styling


How It Works

Start Button → Uses setInterval() to increment time every second.
Pause Button → Uses clearInterval() to stop the timer without resetting.
Reset Button → Clears the time variables and updates the display to zero.
JavaScript DOM Manipulation → Updates the stopwatch display in real-time.
